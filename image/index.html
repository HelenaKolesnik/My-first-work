    <p class="Text">The tornado is still a poorly understood atmospheric phenomenon, and the main snag is that it is very difficult to study it experimentally. Tornadoes occur quite often, but it is impossible to predict exactly where it will occur next time, and therefore you have to “chase” a tornado. The mobile labs used in such chases are too fragile and are destroyed before they can reach the center of the tornado and begin to study it.</p>
